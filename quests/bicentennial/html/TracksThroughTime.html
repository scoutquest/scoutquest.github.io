<p>
  This natural spring has drawn life to this spot for centuries. Long before
  Nashville became a city—or Tennessee a state—people and animals alike gathered
  here. Its steady waters made it a vital meeting place, a source of sustenance,
  and ultimately the reason this location was chosen as the state’s capital.
  Though the spring is now hidden, its legacy continues to shape the land and
  the stories we remember.
