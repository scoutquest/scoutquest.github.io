  Formed in the late 1860s at Nashville’s Fisk University, this vocal ensemble
  took spirituals beyond Tennessee and introduced them to audiences worldwide.
  Their groundbreaking tours funded the university’s mission to educate people
  newly freed from enslavement—and, as legend has it, upon playing for the Queen
  of England, the queen stated the Fisk Jubilee Singers must come from a \"City
  of Music.\" More than 150 years later, the Fisk Jubilee Singers continue to
  perform, preserving their stirring harmonies and sustaining the tradition that
  first placed Nashville on the global music map.
