<p>
  The Volunteer State.<br />
  Tennessee earned its nickname during the War of 1812, when an overwhelming
  number of Tennesseans volunteered to join the fight—so many, in fact, that the
  name stuck. That spirit of service didn’t stop there. From the
  Mexican-American War to moments of disaster relief and civic duty, Tennesseans
  have consistently stepped forward when called. “Volunteer” isn’t just a
  name—it’s a legacy of commitment, pride, and readiness to serve that continues
  to define the state today.
