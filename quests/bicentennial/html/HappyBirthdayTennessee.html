  Held in 1897, the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was a grand celebration of
  the state’s first hundred years. Thousands came to Nashville to see new
  inventions, listen to music, and walk the elaborate fairgrounds. The event
  left behind more than memories—it gave the city its full-scale Parthenon and
  helped shape its future as a cultural capital.
